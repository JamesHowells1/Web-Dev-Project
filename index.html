            <h2>What Is Genshin Impact?</h2>
            <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing video game developed and published by the Chinese game development studio miHoYo. It was released in September 2020 for various platforms, including Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android. The game features an open-world environment and incorporates elements of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving.</p>
            <p>In Genshin Impact, players assume the role of the "Traveler," who embarks on a journey across the fantasy world of Teyvat. The game offers a diverse cast of playable characters, each with unique abilities and elemental powers. Players can switch between different characters during combat to utilize their skills and create powerful combinations.</p>
            <p>The game's exploration mechanics allow players to traverse various regions, discover hidden treasures, and interact with non-playable characters (NPCs) to progress through the main storyline and side quests. Genshin Impact also features a cooperative multiplayer mode, enabling players to team up with friends to tackle challenging dungeons and bosses together.</p>
            <p>With its stunning visuals, immersive world, and engaging gameplay, Genshin Impact has gained popularity among players worldwide. It continues to receive regular updates, introducing new content, characters, and story chapters to expand the game's universe.</p>

            <h2>Genshin's Gacha System</h2>
            <p>Genshin Impact, developed by miHoYo, features a gacha system that has both captivated and sparked controversy within the gaming community. This open-world action RPG allows players to make "Wishes" using in-game currency, such as Primogems or Fate, to obtain characters, weapons, and resources. The gacha system operates similarly to loot boxes found in other games, with two main wish types: Character Wishes and Weapon Wishes, each with dedicated banners featuring specific items.</p>
            <p>Items in Genshin Impact's gacha system are categorized into different rarity tiers, ranging from 3-star to 5-star. Higher rarity items are more powerful and unique, but the chances of obtaining them are relatively low. The game ensures transparency by publicly disclosing the gacha system's rates. Primogems serve as the primary in-game currency, which players can earn through quests, chests, and events, or purchase with real money, allowing both free-to-play and paying players to participate.</p>
            <p>While the gacha system in Genshin Impact offers an opportunity to acquire rare and desirable items, it has faced criticism for potential addictive tendencies and the absence of a guaranteed pity system. Some players appreciate the excitement and anticipation it brings, while others express frustration over what they perceive as predatory aspects. In response to player feedback, miHoYo has introduced additional methods to obtain characters and weapons, including events and the in-game shop, demonstrating their commitment to addressing concerns and striving for player satisfaction while maintaining the financial sustainability of the game.</p>
